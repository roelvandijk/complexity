*** Fitting ***

Usefull functions to try and fit on the data:

constant     |  f(n) = a
logarithmic  |  f(n) = (b * log n) + a
linear       |  f(n) = (b * n) + a
quadratic    |  f(n) = (c * n^2) + (b * n) + a
exponential  |  f(n) = b^n


*** Calculate overhead ***

Overhead can be expressed as (measured time / total time).
